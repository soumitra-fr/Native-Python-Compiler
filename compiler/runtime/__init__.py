"""
Runtime Library - Minimal runtime support for compiled code

This module provides runtime support functions that compiled code
can call for operations that need runtime support:
- Memory allocation
- String operations  
- Print/IO
- Error handling

Phase: 1.4 (Runtime)
"""

# For Phase 1, we keep the runtime minimal.
# Most operations are compiled directly to LLVM/native code.
# This file serves as a placeholder for future runtime functions.

# Future runtime functions (Phase 2+):
# - gc_alloc() - Garbage collection
# - py_print() - Print function
# - py_str_concat() - String concatenation
# - py_list_append() - List operations
# - py_raise_exception() - Exception handling

print("Runtime library loaded (Phase 1 - minimal)")
