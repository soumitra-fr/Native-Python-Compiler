## 🎬 RECOMMENDED START SEQUENCE

### Phase 1: Foundation (Today - 6 hours)
1. **Strings** (2 hours) → Most critical missing feature
2. **Lists** (2 hours) → Second most critical  
3. **Dicts** (2 hours) → Complete the trio

**After this**: Can compile 50% more real Python code

### Phase 2: AI Upgrade (Tomorrow - 8 hours)
1. **Install torch-geometric** (10 min)
2. **Build GNN architecture** (3 hours)
3. **Prepare training data** (2 hours)
4. **Train on Colab** (3 hours)

**After this**: Production-grade AI type inference

### Phase 3: Keep Building (Day 3+)
- Exceptions, classes, imports
- Deep RL optimization
- C extension interface
- Testing & documentation

- [ ] Can run real programs

### Target (Week 3)  
- [ ] 90% Python syntax supported
- [ ] 5-20x average speedup

## 🔥 THE TRUTH

### What's Achievable (100%)
- ✅ Build complete type system (strings, lists, dicts, objects)
- ✅ Train production-grade AI models (GNN + Deep RL)
- ✅ Get 5-500x speedups (depending on workload)
- ✅ Support 90-95% of Python syntax
- ✅ Create publication-ready research

### What's Hard But Doable (80%)
- ⚠️ Match PyPy's 4x average (realistic target: 3-10x)
- ⚠️ CPython test suite 85% pass rate
- ⚠️ NumPy/Pandas full integration
- ⚠️ Perfect debugging experience

### What's Unrealistic (<20%)
- ❌ Beat Numba on pure numeric (they have 10 years head start)
- ❌ 100% CPython compatibility (impossible for one person)
- ❌ Production deployment at scale (need team)
- ❌ Beat GCC/Clang on C code (not even trying)
