## üìà How to Make It State-of-the-Art

### Immediate Improvements (1-2 weeks)

#### 1. **Upgrade Type Inference**

Replace RandomForest with CodeBERT:

```python
# Instead of:
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Use:
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    "microsoft/codebert-base",
    num_labels=len(type_classes)
)

# Or even better - use existing type inference models:
from type4py import Type4Py
predictor = Type4Py.load_model()
types = predictor.predict_types(code)
```

**Expected improvement:** 70% ‚Üí 90% accuracy

#### 2. **Upgrade Strategy Agent**

Replace Q-learning with Deep Q-Network (DQN):

```python
# Instead of tabular Q-table, use neural network:
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, action_dim)
        )
    
    def forward(self, state):
        return self.network(state)

# Use experience replay, target networks, etc.
```

**Expected improvement:** Better generalization, handles unseen code

Use CodeBERT embeddings for code representation:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/codebert-base")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("microsoft/codebert-base")

def get_code_embedding(code_snippet):
    inputs = tokenizer(code_snippet, return_tensors="pt")
